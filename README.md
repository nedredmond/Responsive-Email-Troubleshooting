# Responsive-Email-Troubleshooting
Three (of many) e-mail templates I have created for The Barnes Foundation. Only one has a right-side margin issue on iPhone 6s and up. Looking for help!

All of my one-column templates work great. All of my two-column templates work great. All of my three-column templates have this problem. It is especially perplexing because I based my one- and two-column templates off the three-column template. I have uploaded one example of each. Please reach out if you have any insights.

Thank you,
Ned
